                                Goang-Ming Yuan is the most famous video artist from Taiwan. He started his career in 1984, using metaphor and technology to symbolize the life of every human being. Also, the artwork has a very poetic and in-depth display of human perception and consciousness. Goang-Ming includes Iconology, Social History, and postcolonialism theory in his career. It describes our life and shows Taiwan's history and Global issues<a href="#artist_sorce1">[1]</a>.

                            Although Yuan Guangming always creates works with contemporary materials or technological media, he is always anxious about the passage of time and changes<a href="#artist_sorce2">[2]</a>. Whether it is social changes or the operation of life, there are always situations that cannot be peaceful or even accompany crises at any time—state, which Unpeaceful can also feel in his creations. Every artist's creative origin is different. Yuan Guangming is frank. His creative origin comes from a "question about life and discomfort with time," so his creative process has never been comfortable; only after the work is completed will there be a brief sense of healing<a href="#artist_sorce3">[3]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regarding understanding time, Yuan Guangming has different ideas about seeing time from his youth until he became a father. When he was young, he came from a family with hopeless Confucianism. His father insisted that "if you can't handle it yourself, you are not qualified to criticize the environment," which made him completely stuck in Confucianism<a href="#artist_sorce4">[4]</a>. Therefore, the original works were centered on "I," with situations in which life was involuntary and could not break free from social and moral constraints. "Cage" and "Fish on Dish" were representative works of that time.

                            The time came to around 2000 AD, interactive art began to develop globally, and artists pursued more technical aspects. Many artists were often obsessed with technical research and ignored the concept of artistic creation. Therefore, he decided to let himself be creative. Back to another original point, I tried manually processing photos and images in slow and time-consuming craftsmanship to create the <a href="city_disqualified.html">"City Disqualified"</a> series <a href="#artist_sorce2">[2]</a>. The work of <a href="city_disqualified.html">"City Disqualified"</a> took two months. This artwork took more than 300 photos at the same fixed point. After stacking the images, Goang-Ming Yuan removed all the people and cars, so the pictures showed the state of an empty city. This work is magnificent, it has a sense of silence of doomsday, but it makes people feel creepy <a href="#artist_sorce2">[2]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="city_disqualified.html">"City Disqualified"</a> also tells about the changes in Taiwan's history. Perhaps that's why Yuan Guangming began to explore the context of Taiwan's history. The Nationalist government moved to Taiwan from China in 1949. People at that time had too many thoughts of distant family members, prompting Yuan Guang ming to Create immersive works "Towards Darkness" and "Towards Light" so that the next generation could also experience the same experience through visual touch and hearing <a href="#artist_sorce5">[5]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the above works, one can feel the sense of being "unsettled," as mentioned at the beginning. Whether it is self-suppression or historical sorrow, a sense of depression will collapse at any time. Yuan Guangming, who entered the family, also realized that many families or groups have different anxiety. <a href="dwelling.html">"Dwelling"</a> is his work describing this matter. The seemingly peaceful living room exploded in the next second, and after the explosion, it returned to a relaxed state and kept repeating. Like a dream, it is unpredictable and full of crises<a href="#artist_sorce6">[6]</a>.

                                "Art works are like crystals, which can reflect everyone's own imagination. I don't want to refer to a single event, but to explore its essence through art." - Goang-Ming Yuan
