            <h1>Dwelling</h1>
            <h2>Discription</h2>
            <p>
                In this Lopping film, a small family living room with middle-class taste is decorated with elegant home furnishings. However, the seemingly ordinary life scene is a home spectacle of living underwater. Multiple bubbles float up and cooperate with concussions.
                <br>
                Suddenly the living room exploded from it. All the furniture shattered, tossed, and floated in the entire space, and the living room destroyed everything. Then the pieces of furniture suddenly returned, returning to the original serene and peaceful scene. After a while, the living room bursts again and then returns.
            </p>
            <h2>Iconology</h2>
            <p>
                The work "Dwelling" symbols the disturbed of our peaceful life. Goang-Ming said he thinks the safest moment for humans is when we stay in the amniotic fluid. So he puts the living room in the water as the symbol that every area or place we belong to sounds safe but has potential risks.
                <br>
                Explosion always has the meanings of destruction and rebirth. The exploding living room is not only a sign of the issues of every family but also represents the distortion of the global problems. The backtrack after the explosion takes us back to the peaceful state is maybe the sign of the dream. Looping film is the meaning of the non-stop issues.

            <h2>Primary Source</h2>
            <p>
                Goang Ming showed "Dwelling" in his exhibition called "An Uncanny Tomorrow" - the name from the German phycologist Sigmund Freud's theory. The german "Unheimlich" has the same meaning as the word "disturbed," but the root of Unheimlich has the definition of "Home." They call it restless, which means not having the safety and comfort of being at home.

            <h2>Secondary Source</h2>
            <p>
                Goang Ming takes two years on  "Dwelling." This film work as a dream that we always feel peaceful after nightmare—symbols of how weak our lives are. While Goang Ming learning the Zen Buddhism, he was impressed by oe of 10 ways to get started with Zen - "Let your heart always be in a state of shock."
