            <h1>Dwelling</h1>
            <h2>Discription</h2>
            <p>
                In this Lopping film, a small family living room with middle-class taste is decorated with elegant home furnishings. However, the seemingly ordinary life scene is a home spectacle of living underwater. Multiple bubbles float up and cooperate with concussions.
                <br>
                Suddenly the living room exploded from it. All the furniture shattered, tossed, and floated in the entire space, and the living room destroyed everything. Then the pieces of furniture suddenly returned, returning to the original serene and peaceful scene. After a while, the living room bursts again and then returns.
            </p>
            <h2>Iconology</h2>
            <p>
                The work "Dwelling" symbols the disturbed of our peaceful life. Goang-Ming said he thinks the safest moment for humans is when we stay in the amniotic fluid. So he puts the living room in the water as the symbol that every area or place we belong to sounds safe but has potential risks.
                <br>
                Explosion always has the meanings of destruction and rebirth. The exploding living room is not only a sign of the issues of every family but also represents the distortion of the global problems. The backtrack after the explosion takes us back to the peaceful state is maybe the sign of the dream. Looping film is the meaning of the non-stop issues.

            <p>
                Goang Ming showed "Dwelling" in his exhibition called "An Uncanny Tomorrow" - the name from the German phycologist Sigmund Freud's theory. The german "Unheimlich" has the same meaning as the word "disturbed," but the root of Unheimlich has the definition of "Home." They call it restless, which means not having the safety and comfort of being at home.

            <h2>Secondary Source</h2>
            <p>
                Goang Ming takes two years on  "Dwelling." This film work as a dream that we always feel peaceful after nightmare—symbols of how weak our lives are. While Goang Ming learning the Zen Buddhism, he was impressed by oe of 10 ways to get started with Zen - "Let your heart always be in a state of shock."

            <h2>Visual Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Yuan Guangming's works have always been intended to make people [reflect] on today's social phenomena. He brings viewers an "unsettled" mood in each of his works, which makes people surrounded by a somewhat oppressive atmosphere<a href="#dwelling_sorce2">[2]</a>. Using a lot of formalism and iconography to make the audience immersive, the artwork "Dwelling" is a good example.
                <br>
                From the theme of this work, the seemingly stable living room symbolizes our daily life and various behaviors that seem to be smooth. A home represents "stable" and can be presented in many works. We use games as an example. Usually, when playing RPG games, most starting points are adventures from home, such as Pokémon games. It is even a symbol of safety. For example, in most survival games, entering the house will not be attacked by outsiders and even a saving spot for players. Aiming at "unrest" as an aesthetic theme, Freud (Sigmund Freud, 1856-1939) once traced the underlying spiritual origin from the perspective of psychoanalysis. His analysis pointed out that the source of fear and terror is closely related to "home" (the German word Heimlich means "homely")<a href="#dwelling_sorce6">[6]</a>. Dwelling's work then begins to pop out of a little bubble, which is an essential part of giving the audience the "unstable" factor, deepening the fear of uncertainty in the future, just like an earthquake before a volcano erupts. With a bit of mute-like ambient sound, it seems that the time is infinitely extended, and at the same time, it also allows the audience to focus more on the picture.
                <br>
                When everyone was concentrating on the peaceful picture, the sudden dramatic explosion in the living room at this time was the most significant turning point for this work, and it also described the impact brought by the unrest. Before the explosion, few clues would cause the explosion except for the bubbles and the explosion. This is the "future instability" that Yuan Guangming wanted to express. Any single person or thing may cause future changes. After the explosion, it is reversed and returned to the initial picture of calm, which symbolizes that no matter the changes will eventually usher in the uneasy calm again. It also means that it will show disintegration again at any time.
                <br>
                In the picture presentation, Yuan Guangming used various items that belonged to the family, such as newspapers, teapots, sofas, and blankets, to create the appearance that an ordinary family living room should have. In addition, he dimmed the brightness, not too much The components of the multi-bright color system also create a seemingly warm but uncomfortable sense of disobedience. Among them, whether it is a sofa, pillow, teapot, or table, they are all in plain colors so that audience can read each object, and it is also a way to enhance the viewer's concentration.
                <br>
                The work was done in water, except that Yuan Guangming described it as a symbol of being in the amniotic fluid. It was to match the blasting effect. The resistance in the water can inhibit the more minor components from flying too far after blasting, and the most important thing is the buoyancy that can penetrate the water so that the objects can show the tension of floating in the air after the blast.
                <br>
                Dwelling's work is a series of works, "An Uncanny Tomorrow," and another work, "Tomorrowland, " also uses blasting as an element. The scene is changed from the living room to an amusement park. Although the meanings of the two are different, the concept of the explosion is consistent<a href="#dwelling_sorce7">[7]</a>.
