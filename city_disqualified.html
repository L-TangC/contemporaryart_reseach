            <h2>Discription</h2>
            <p>
                Ximen District is one of the series from City Disqualified. All the photo looks like simple photograph work, but Goang-Ming took almost two months shooting over 300 pictures in Ximen District. He used the technology of "copy" and "paste" to remove all the cars and citizens. Goang-Ming uses this technology to turn the busy street, Ximen Description, into a quiet area. Allow the audience to examine the city in other ways.
            </p>
            <h2>Postcolonialism</h2>
            <p>
                Ximending is a name left over from the Japanese occupation period and is still in use today. Ximending is also known as Taipei Harajuku, but Goang-Ming thinks Ximending has no connection with Harajuku. It is kind of a theory called Delocalization. Always feel that although we live here, our ideal place must be another city.
                <br>
                We will call City Disqualified a city without citizens. Seeing a familiar thing transformed into another form enables us to re-examine and understand its history.

                "Alive" are the issues that Goang Ming wants to talk mention. The empty city allows others to have a reflection on the meanings. Not only thinks re-think the view, but also the connection between the name and the area. We often use foreign words to name a new apartment project for sale, New York or Little Tokyo. 
                Let others have an imagination for a better future or great life. Delocalization means that we forget the meaning and the beauty of the area.

            <h2>Secondary Source</h2>
            <p>
                Goang Ming uses the abstract concept of time to transform physical space into images. 
                Leaving the footprints of people's lives and activities, this vivid but hollowed-out sense of contradiction further arouses the viewers' curiosity. The viewers can feel the anxiety of the past or even now from these empty city landscapes.
