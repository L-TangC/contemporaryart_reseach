            <h2>Discription</h2>
            <p>
                Ximen District is one of the series from City Disqualified. All the photo looks like simple photograph work, but Goang-Ming took almost two months shooting over 300 pictures in Ximen District. He used the technology of "copy" and "paste" to remove all the cars and citizens. Goang-Ming uses this technology to turn the busy street, Ximen Description, into a quiet area. Allow the audience to examine the city in other ways.
            </p>
            <h2>Postcolonialism</h2>
            <p>
                Ximending is a name left over from the Japanese occupation period and is still in use today. Ximending is also known as Taipei Harajuku, but Goang-Ming thinks Ximending has no connection with Harajuku. It is kind of a theory called Delocalization. Always feel that although we live here, our ideal place must be another city.
                <br>
                We will call City Disqualified a city without citizens. Seeing a familiar thing transformed into another form enables us to re-examine and understand its history.
