            <h1>City Disqualified – Ximen District</h1>
            <h2>Discription</h2>
            <p>
                Ximen District is one of the series from City Disqualified. All the photo looks like simple photograph work, but Goang-Ming took almost two months shooting over 300 pictures in Ximen District. He used the technology of "copy" and "paste" to remove all the cars and citizens. Goang-Ming uses this technology to turn the busy street, Ximen Description, into a quiet area. Allow the audience to examine the city in other ways.
            </p>
            <h2>Postcolonialism</h2>
            <p>
                Ximending is a name left over from the Japanese occupation period and is still in use today. Ximending is also known as Taipei Harajuku, but Goang-Ming thinks Ximending has no connection with Harajuku. It is kind of a theory called Delocalization. Always feel that although we live here, our ideal place must be another city.
                <br>
                We will call City Disqualified a city without citizens. Seeing a familiar thing transformed into another form enables us to re-examine and understand its history.

                "Alive" are the issues that Goang Ming wants to talk mention. The empty city allows others to have a reflection on the meanings. Not only thinks re-think the view, but also the connection between the name and the area. We often use foreign words to name a new apartment project for sale, New York or Little Tokyo. 
                Let others have an imagination for a better future or great life. Delocalization means that we forget the meaning and the beauty of the area.

            <h2>Secondary Source</h2>
            <p>
                Goang Ming uses the abstract concept of time to transform physical space into images. 
                Leaving the footprints of people's lives and activities, this vivid but hollowed-out sense of contradiction further arouses the viewers' curiosity. The viewers can feel the anxiety of the past or even now from these empty city landscapes.
            </p>
            <h2>Visual Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                The work "City Disqualification - Ximending" seems to be a photo-generated by technology, transforming a busy street scene into an empty city. This is a reflection related to history. It took several months to take hundreds of photos at the exact location and then select dozens for stacking, digging out the blocks of people and cars, and recombining the remaining empty scenes into a photo with no one. To create a street scene with no one, Yuan Guangming used his best method to evoke "discomfort" in people's hearts.
                <br>
                We use the title of the work as a preliminary analysis. The name "City Disqualification" is taken from the book "Disqualification in the World" by Japanese writer Osamu Dazai (1909-1948). This indicates that cities that lose human activities will lose their qualifications as cities. This empty replica city is also used as a metaphor for the indifference and alienation of human beings in modern life. To cause anxiety and anxiety in the viewing process and call on the viewer's feelings of longing for redemption <a href="#city_dis_sorce5">[5]</a>.
                <br>
                From a historical point of view, the place name "Ximending" is derived from the place name left over from the Japanese occupation period. This is also the footprint of Taiwan's historical and cultural growth. Therefore, when "people" are taken away, it is also represented in a particular area. With the stagnation of civilization, everyone imagines the desolation and fear that may bring after the world's end<a href="#city_dis_sorce6">[6]</a>.
                <br>
                City Disqualified produced another version of Liverpool similarly in the series of urban disqualification works. However, the cultural conditions of Taipei and Liverpool are different, and the buildings left after people are removed cultural relics. , Taipei Ximending is a completely urbanized scene. Although it is a product of the Japanese occupation period, only the name has the blood of inheriting the culture, and the city's appearance is only full of high-rise buildings. Liverpool in the UK, on ​​the other hand, has retained some cultural impressions. Perhaps, for this reason, the deserted streets of Liverpool are warmer.

                The whole series of works of "City Disqualification," from the perspective of color tone, all look like pictures of bright sunshine. Still, with the color palette of cool colors, the streets that are already empty are even more deserted. This runs through the central axis of "uncomfortable" and "uneasy," and like the artwork "Dwelling," it exudes uncertainty about the future, allowing the audience to face the fear of instability.
